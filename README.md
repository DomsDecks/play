# Doms Decks

This is an entirely front end website that allows users to draw random cards from a deck.

It can be used to supplement board games with custom or changed content. I designed it to house my homebrew expansion for Betrayal at House on the Hill.

The player who initiates the game generates unique links for themselves and every other player. Each link contains a random subset of the deck to draw from in a random order.

There is no server side synchronisation so players actions don't affect one another; a flaw, but one that keeps the project light.
